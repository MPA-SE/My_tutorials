    <h1>LEARNING FRENCH AS A NIGERIAN</h1>

    <p>It would interest you to know that I have never been to France. Well, not physically anyway. LOL.
        I have been there in my dreams, lived vicariously by others who have on social media and seen pictures
        and videos. Yet, I have learnt the language to the point that I became fluent, IN NIGERIA!
        Incase you don't know. Nigeria is located in the Western part of Africa. She was colonized by
        Britain, not France. Nonetheless, there are a lot of francophiles here. And our neighbours are francophones.

    <p><button>How did I achieve this?</button>
    I have been learning the language right from when I was in Primary school and it was love at first contact.
    I remember my elder sister observing me and how I light up each time I talk about the language for some time;
    and then suggesting I plan to study it more deeply. So, I looked forward to learning French in secondary school.
    And I was not disappointed. I met Monsieur Vitalis Dominique; a Cameroonian teacher who practically groomed
    me for 6 years. He made me the French club president. At French club, we learnt the French culture mostly via
    music and dance. It was like my initiation into the most effective way of learning: fun. And so from there
    and with this attitude, I went on to write my West African Examination Council - WAEC exams; then studied 
    the language in the university and proceeded to writing the Diplômes d'Études de la langue Française - DELF. </p>
    <p>I learn French in an Anglophone community by teaching the language, playing games, enjoying French music
        and watching French movies, just like Monsieur Vitalis taught me.

    <p>Yes, we can tell by now that I love languages: be it French, English or Javascript. LOL. What motivated
        me? Technology and how fast it was everything was evolving. I did not want to be left behind. I mean,
        nobody wants this, right? I mean not being able to communicate with the robots.

    <p><button>How did I achieve this?</button>
    I started my journey with the African Leadership - ALX Software Engineering Programme in 2022. Then continued 
    my learning with FREE CODE CAMP. Then went on to W3 SCHOOLS. And UDEMY. The truth is that in all of these learning 
    quests I still felt like it was not enough. I still felt overwhelmed, confused and insufficient. </p>
    <p>The game changer was when I went to my second tech event and the guest speaker emphasized the need for a mentor.
        And one of my fellow tech sisters; the one who inspired me to take the ALX course, got a mentor that put her 
        on the right track.
        Then I started praying to God that I find a mentor best suited to me. I kept searching far and wide - talking to
        everyone I knew in tech. Finally, one sunday evening, I met a church member's husband coding and I screamed 
        when I discovered that he had been into tech for many many years and was willing to mentor me! isn't God good?!
