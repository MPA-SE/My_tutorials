    <h1>THE LEARNING SPACE</h1>
    <p>My name is Priscilla. I am a French tutor who is learning to be a full stack software engineer.
        I am passionate about learning. I also love to write. I believe in Jesus Christ and His finished 
        work of grace on the cross.
    </p>
    <p>This blog is a project assignment I undertook in my quest to learn HTML. I am currently learning with Frontend 
        Masters, under the directives of my mentor- Uncle Mark.
    </p>
    <p>I take this assignment personally because of two things: one, I love learning and two, I love people.
        So, I am learning to create a blog where I can document my learning experiences and share them with others.
    </p>
    <p>Here is a list of some of my learning experiences thus far:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>International Studies and Diplomacy</li>
        <li>French as a Foreign Language</li>
        <li>The Montessori System</li>
        <li>Children Ministry</li>
        <li>Financial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Human Relationships</li>
        <li>Purpose</li>
        <li>Software Engineering</li>
        <li>and much more...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can find write ups about some of my learning experiences in the POSTS section.</p>
