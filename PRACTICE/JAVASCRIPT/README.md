SOME NOTES ON JS:
- When you write codes, in general, instead of just being clever, aim to be clear. It's better to use a word that gives an insight, instead of single letter variables. In a quest to shorten the codes, it can be very unclear, when others come to read it, like years after, when codes have evolved. Check out "Code Gulf", for more explanation. it's true that people can worry about the length of the codes, however think of humans first before the computer. Computers are faster these days.
- VAR is the old way of declaring variables, since 2015; when ES6 [a new Javascript: called EcmaScript], then LET was introduced for changeable variables and CONST for unchangeable ones. Now they release new versions of JavaScript every year.
- "Camel casing" is how everyone writes variable names in JavaScript. For example: const Jansalary
- The semi-colon at the end of lines of codes that are important, like in CSS, are optional in JS.
- There is something called REPL[Read Eval Print Loop], it just let's you interact directly with your codes, right in your browser. Go to INSPECT, then CONSOLE. Or < opt command i> on Macbook. And <ctrl shift i> on WINDOWS.
- The backtick helps us concatenate without having to use plus signs and air quotes(for spaces in between) instaed with dollar signs and curly braces.
- Booleans are useful for conditions that are like light switches, e.g if light switch is on(true) and off(false)...
    let IsLightOn = true
- Numbers are numbers in JS. No need to differentiate an integer from a float, etc.
- CONTROL FLOW: IF statements - variables are assigned by one =. three === is the mathematical equal to...and <= and >= and !=... It is then followed by an else. There is an ELSE if statement for multiple scenarios - to help you cover everything. The funny thing is, when there are unexpected/unaccounted for inputs, that how bugs come in. lol.
