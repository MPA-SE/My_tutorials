SOME NOTES ON JS:
- When you write codes, in general, instead of just being clever, aim to be clear. It's better to use a word that gives an insight, instead of single letter variables. In a quest to shorten the codes, it can be very unclear, when others come to read it, like years after, when codes have evolved. Check out "Code Gulf", for more explanation. it's true that people can worry about the length of the codes, however think of humans first before the computer. Computers are faster these days.
- VAR is the old way of declaring variables, since 2015; when ES6 [a new Javascript: called EcmaScript], then LET was introduced for changeable variables and CONST for unchangeable ones. Now they release new versions of JavaScript every year.
- "Camel casing" is how everyone writes variable names in JavaScript. For example: const Jansalary
- The semi-colon at the end of lines of codes that are important, like in CSS, are optional in JS.
- There is something called REPL[Read Eval Print Loop], it just let's you interact directly with your codes, right in your browser. Go to INSPECT, then CONSOLE. Or < opt command i> on Macbook. And <ctrl shift i> on WINDOWS.
- Shock alert: apart from using single/double quotes for string of characters, you can use a backtick too! And the sweet thing about them is that it is only with them that you can put in multiple lines of text!
