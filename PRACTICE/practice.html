        Well, it allows me use special characters in text

       The <code>h1</code> tag creates a main header.
    </p>
    <h2>
        This is the first subheading
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <code>h2</code> tag creates a subheading.
    </p>
    <h3>
        This is the second subheading
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <code>h3</code> tag creates yet another subheading 
        and we can keep going like this till <code>h6!</code>

<h1 class="Using-unordered-lists">
    SO WHAT HAVE I LEARNT SO FAR?
</h1>
    <p>HTML tags like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>header tags: h1-h6</li>
        <li>paragraph tag</li>
        <li>img tag</li>
        <li>division tag</li>
        <li>button tag</li>
        <li>ordered and unordered list tags</li>
        <li>anchor tag</li>
        <li>Input tags</li>
        <li>Form tags</li>
	    <li>table tag</li>
	    <li>marquee tag</li>
	    <li>break tag</li>
        <li>section/nav/article tag: they're same as division tag</li>
        <li>Head,meta, html and body tags</li>
        <li>code tag</li>
    </ul>
    <!--there are some self-closing tags like: img tag, input tag, break tag-->
    <p>Attributes, Classes and IDS</p>
    <p>Attributes define the behaviors of tags. Classes will make more sense when learning CSS
        for now I understand that they help me define what type of tag I am using and they are reusable.
        IDS on the other hand are not reusable. They are unique.

    <!--I just learnt that I can generate LOREM IPSUM TEXT by typing:

    <!--I also just learnt that it is common practice is to put hyphens in between
    class attributes; and so I did-->
